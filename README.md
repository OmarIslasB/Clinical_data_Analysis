# Clinical_data_Analysis

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I showcase a collection of projects and works
related to the analysis of clinical trial data and patient clinical data.

In this repository, you will find examples of data extraction, cleansing, manipulation,
and visualization, also some statistical analyses. 

My goal is to provide useful tools and resources for healthcare professionals
and data scientists interested in enhancing the quality and efficiency of clinical analyses.

I hope you find this portfolio valuable and invite you to explore and collaborate!!
